## **Objective**
Instacart requested an initial and exploratory analysis based on customer purchasing behaviors. The purpose of the analysis is to inform a marketting strategy to target certain customer profiles with appropropriate products.

## **Data**
The Instacart data included data sets on orders, orders_products_prior, products, customers, and departments
- **Data Dictionary** [here](https://gist.github.com/jeremystan/c3b39d947d9b88b3ccff3147dbcf6c6b)
- **Career Foundry Data Set** [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/coach-courses-us/public/courses/data-immersion/A4/A4_Data_Assets/customers.zip)
-  **Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017** [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis)

## **Tools**
### Language: Python
### Libraries: pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn
### Software: Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda, Excel

## **Project Deliverables**
*Note: Career Foundry project request was to create a summary report in excel form. In practice this would be in the form of a powerpoint and/or Tableau or PowerBI dashboard. 
- **Summary Report and Visualizations** [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19KXQNd11rXzZ3jjmIP9fUKeuAUKRCg_u/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117787708180877229785&rtpof=true&sd=true)

## **Project Folders**
The analysis was stored in a file containing the following folders. 
- 01 Project Management: Contains the Instacart Project Brief
- 02 Data: Separated into Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original data frames and the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. NOTE: This folder has not been included
- 03 Scripts: Contains all the Python coding involved for the entire analysis process. The scripts are organized based on the flow of the Career Foundry exercises. 
- 04 Analysis: Contains the visualizations derived from Python analysis and used for developing insights within the final report 
- 05 Sent to client: Contains the Final Report in Excel *As noted above, the Excel format was required by Career Foundry. All visualizations and insights could be presented as a PowerPoint or dashboard as another method

## **Skills Demonstrated**
- **Python coding**: consistency checks, transforming data, groupby() function, aggregations, creating new variables, exclusion flags, subsetting, data frame merges, merge flags, user-defined functions, loc function, for loops, crosstabs, random sampling, visualization
- **Visualizations**: Utilized matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, and scipy to create bar plots, histograms, and scatterplots in python
- **Analytical Process**: Data cleaning within exploratory data analysis (EDA)- data frame shape, data types, outliers, duplicates, missing values, consistency checks, preparation for merging data frames 
- **Business Skills**: demographic profiling, data security (PII specific), data ethics, marketting segmentation, summary reports, translating complex data into marketting and sales insights
